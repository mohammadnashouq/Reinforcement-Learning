# Reinforcement-Learning
In this Jyputer Notebook I solved the cartpole-v1 game on GYM envirunment: https://www.gymlibrary.ml/environments/classic_control/cart_pole/ using 4 different
networks DQN, Double DQN, dueling dqn, and Policy iteration method that uses the advantage function ( actor critic methods).

in the Report file there is more details about the 4 methods and the performance for each one.
